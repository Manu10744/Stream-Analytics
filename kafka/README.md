An Apache Kafka Streaming Environment has three main components:

- **Producers**: They **produce** the data and send them to the Kafka Cluster, which stores it in a specified Kafka **Topic**
- **Broker**: Receives new data and stores it in the corresponding Topic
- **Consumers**: Subscribes to a topic and thus receives a stream of the data
