<hr>

The purpose of this project is to analyze and compare two famous Streaming Platforms, **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Flink**, regarding metrics like Throughput, Latency, Processing Speed and Scalability in a both Non-Parallel and Parallel Streaming Scenario.

The results are documented in a conference paper.

#### Terminology
- Throughput: Amount of MBs sent per unit time (e.g. second)
- Latency: Amount of elapsed time between the point of sending a stream object and receiving it
